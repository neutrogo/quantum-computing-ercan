# quantum-computing-ercan

This repository focuses on applying the quantum computing concepts I have been studying through textbooks and other resources. It contains Jupyter notebooks that put theory into practice using Qiskit, as preparation for future research in the field.

Most of the work here is based on:
- *Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing* by T. Wong
- *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* by Nielsen & Chuang
- Qiskit textbooks and related tutorials

## Learning Goals
- Reinforce my understanding of quantum computing by **implementing concepts I have studied (Wong, Nielsen & Chuang)**
- Strengthen intuition for the **mathematics and physics of quantum computing through hands-on experimentation**
- Gain practical skills in **quantum circuits, algorithms, and state visualisation with Qiskit**
- Build a solid foundation for **future research in quantum computing**

## Structure
- `notebooks/` â€“ Jupyter notebooks documenting concepts and experiments

Please note: to run these notebooks on actual quantum computers, you will need to code the setup yourself locally, using your respective API token.

> This repository is a work-in-progress and will evolve as I deepen my understanding of quantum computing.
